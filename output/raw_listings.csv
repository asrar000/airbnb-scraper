The room looked better that on the pictures. For the price, it is worth it and especially the location that is next to many great things to do all by walk or super well connected. Staff super friendly and helpful, was able to put our bags somewhere while waiting for the checking time. Nothing fancy but great for an in city stay at affordable price with lovely people. Convenient mini market next to it as well, perfect.
One note to know, there isn't hot water in the shower, that's the point to be aware but it wasn't a problem for us as it was very warm

The room was a bit dirty and tired but the bed was clean, fresh and comfortable.

Worth my money! Looks exactly how it looks at the photos. I'd say it's really enough for 1 to 2 people. There's a nearby mosque so you'll hear their call to prayer 5x a day but it's fine. I'd prefer staying here rather than in Bukit Bintang area coz it's less chaotic on this side. It's walking distance to several landmarks and close to MRT as well.
Derek and the girl receptionist (Sorry I forgot her name) were very accommodating and helpful too. Would definitely stay here again!

Derek was extremely helpful and accomodative. My mother was traveling without me in Malaysia and I was worried. Derek took care of everything and the place made her feel super comfortable.
The location was absolutely amazing, something my mother was raving about. I would absolutely recommend the stay and would definitely book it again if I visit Kuala Lumpur.

We had a mixed experience at this hotel. We requested a twin room but received a different one. The room was very small, and even our carry ons suitcases barely fit. The location was also challenging. It’s near a mosque, so prayer calls can be loud, and we frequently heard ambulance sirens even at night. Several Grab drivers warned us not to walk around at night as the area may be unsafe. A 7-Eleven right outside was convenient though.
Cleanliness was disappointing. There was visible hair, the bathroom smelled bad, and towels didn’t smell fresh. Even after requesting housekeeping, we weren’t given toilet tissue. Bottled water listed in the amenities wasn’t provided. Guests must refill from a lobby dispenser. No power adapters are available, so bring your own.
Derek was responsive, which we appreciated. For the price, we understand, but we wouldn’t stay again or recommend it.

Derek, as a host, was really helpful. the room was really near Masjid India that we can hear adzan 5 times a day. love it!
it's also near landmarks; Merdeka Square, Masjid Jamek, River of Life. we even walked to the Central Market just within 10 minutes from the hotel.
overall, absolutely having a good 2 nights stay. thank you!

The Personal at the Place was also really friendly and helpful.
Unfortunately the room was not really clean when we arrived. There were stains on the bed sheets and when we requested new ones there were stains on them too. There were also very many hairs on the floor which weren’t ours.
The late checkout was perfect and the communication with the host was also flawless.

I had a fantastic stay at Derek Host located at Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman (Jalan TAR). The location was super strategic — close to shops, food stalls, and everything I needed. The room was clean, cozy, and very comfortable. Derek was a friendly and helpful host, making sure I had a smooth and enjoyable stay. I really appreciated the peaceful environment right in the heart of the city. Highly recommended for anyone visiting KL. Thank you, Derek!
